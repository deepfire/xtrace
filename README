		XTRACE 0.10
		-----------

What strace is for system calls, xtrace is for X11 connections:
you hook it between one or more X11 clients and an X server and
it prints the requests going from client to server and the replies,
events and errors going the other way.

Short howto:
Run xtrace, which defaults to listening at :9 and forwarding to
your current $DISPLAY.

Then simply start other clients after setting DISPLAY=:9 or
giving them -display :9 and see all the data flowing in a far
to verbose form.

Things still to do (any volunteers?):
	- test, test, test
	  (currently only what I needed is tested, and as I calculated
	   offsets by hand and copy&pasted a lot, there might still be
	   some errors).
	- implement the common extensions.
	   (currently only implemented are the base protocol and
	    the following extensions:
	    BIG-REQUESTS, DAMAGE, DPMS, MIT-SCREEN-SAVER, MIT-SHM,
	    RANDR, RENDER, SHAPE, XFIXES, XFree86-VidModeExtension,
	    XFree86-Bigfont and XINERAMA)
	- make it less verbose or even better allow to control
	  verbosity.
	- implement some filtering
	- implement life modification. (Currently only supported
	  by changing the source, look for requestButtonGrab in
	  parse.c for an example. Being able to do this via
	  command line would be nice.)
